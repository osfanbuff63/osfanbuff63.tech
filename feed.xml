<p>If you haven’t read my <a href="/2022/06/15/github-thoughts">original thoughts</a>, I highly recommend it before reading this post.</p>

<p>So @Livedollar brought up on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/github-community/discussions/18153#discussioncomment-2974715">feedback discussion</a> that the achievements more than likely will actually won’t bring <em>as</em> much bad, since you’ll get it by following the GitHub tutorial for a PR. Personally, this makes me take back my thought that they should remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOLO</code> advancement, so it brings me down to one major point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make advancements only achievable once</li>
</ul>

<p>This is potentially controversal, but I think that takes care of the farming problem <em>perfectly</em>. You see, if you make it so that you only get an advancement once - in the case of YOLO, via the GitHub tutorial - and that reduces the spam problem.</p>

<p>I’d be very interested to hear thoughts on this.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corrections and more food for thought]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New VS Code extension page!</title><link href="https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/16/vscode-extensions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New VS Code extension page!" /><published>2022-06-16T23:55:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T23:55:00+00:00</updated><id>https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/16/vscode-extensions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/16/vscode-extensions.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="vs-code-extension-page-finished">VS Code Extension page finished!</h2>

<p>I spent a really long time (like an hour lol) on this page, which ranks my top 10 VS Code extensions. Here’s a link: <a href="/vscode-extensions">vscode-extensions</a>. Hope you all enjoy!</p>

<p>UPDATE 6-18-2022: Read <a href="/2022/06/18/github-thoughts-correction">this post</a> for some corrections and my latest thoughts. Still read this first though!</p>

<p>As stated in a few new features GitHub has introduced lately (namely: <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/">achievements</a>), I thought I’d spend some time to detail my thoughts on the situation. This is one of a series I’ll be doing when I have time.</p>

<p>This very controversal feature is a step in the wrong direction, and then back. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOLO</code> achievement (merge a PR unreviewed), is next to useless, and encourages bad ideas for open-source projects. It’s also pretty easy to see that people would try to farm them, meaning worse contributions all-around. Overall, this seems like GitHub trying to encourage contributions (note: which is not bad at all!), but in a way that encourages <em>bad</em> contributions instead of good ones, which is simply annoying to project developers, rather than helpful.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that GitHub can 1) Remove the YOLO advancement (as detailed above), 2) Make it so that achievements aren’t farmable, and 3) Disable viewing of them by default. #2 meaning that GitHub would make it so that <em>potentially</em> you wouldn’t be able to get achievements more than once, which sort of solves the farming problem, and #3 meaning that you would have to opt-in to achievements.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that could be done here, and it hasn’t been done right quite yet - but I still think that it could be redone better.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts on Achievements]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World!</title><link href="https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/12/first-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World!" /><published>2022-06-12T11:20:45+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T11:20:45+00:00</updated><id>https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/12/first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://osfanbuff63.github.io/2022/06/12/first-post.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h2>

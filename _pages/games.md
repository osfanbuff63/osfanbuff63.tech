## My games

I've been playing a lot of games between my Nintendo Switch and my new PC ([specs](pc-specs)) - but here's a list of the games I play most, in no particular order.

| Game                   | Platform(s)                      | Links                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minecraft              | Java and Bedrock for PC, Android | [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/)                                         | Probably both my most played game and favorite. I've played many hours in this game over around 2.5 years, and still love it to this day.                                                                                                              |
| Nintendo Switch Sports | Nintendo Switch                  | [nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com](https://nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com/) | I've always been a *huge* fan of the Wii Sports series, and bringing to Switch was a great move by Nintendo. Now - the game could be better, and they don't need to make you pay for Switch Online to have the most fun, but that's besides the point. |
| Cities: Skylines       | PC (Steam)                       | [citiesskylines.com](https://www.citiesskylines.com/)                           | I'm a big road person too - and this game brings them both together in a way that is as so very resemblant of real cities. According to Steam at the time of writing, I have ~30 hours in this game.                                                   |
| Mario Kart 8 Deluxe    | Nintendo Switch                  | [mariokart8.nintendo.com](https://mariokart8.nintendo.com/)                     | This one is a no-brainer - one of the Switch's better games, given the singleplayer content *and* the multiplayer/online and the DLC they are adding makes me kep coming back.                                                                         |
| Super Mario Odyssey    | Nintendo Switch                  | [supermario.nintendo.com](https://supermario.nintendo.com/)                     | Another gem for the Switch. I just started a playthrough and finished it fairly quickly - but I still keep coming back for more.                                                                                                                       |

There's more than just that - but those are what come to my head right now. By the way - I don't have Breath of the Wild, but I've heard it's a great game too.

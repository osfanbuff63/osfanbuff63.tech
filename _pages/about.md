# About osfanbuff63

## Who am I?

I'm a Minecraft datapack creator primarly. However, I also love contributing to open-source projects, and especially writing documentation! I've also more recent experimented with the world of the Nintendo Wii's homebrew (and have contributed to [wii.guide](https://wii.guide) multiple times).

When I'm not playing Minecraft or contributing to a project, I usually shuffle between playing Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Cities: Skylines. On Nintendo games, I go by the name `osfanbuff6` (thanks Nintendo lol). A full list of my favorite games is [here](games), but now that I have Nintendo Switch Online I've been playing a lot of Nintendo Switch Sports

Besides being active on [GitHub](https://github.com/osfanbuff63), I am also active on [Planet Minecraft](https://planetminecraft.com/member/osfanbuff63). I'm also a Helper on [Mojira](https://bugs.mojang.com), and contribute to projects in the [mojira org](https://github.com/mojira) on GitHub.

## Favorite programs

I usually use [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-11) as my OS, but run a Plex server on a Raspberry Pi (tutorial [here](/how-to/raspberry-pi-plex)) running [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/). I'm in the Beta channel of Windows 11 - so I get tabs in File Explorer and many other features of 22H2 before the general public :P.

I'm still using [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) as my browser, but will use Firefox if I need to. ~~My Chrome extensions can be found [here](chrome-extensions)~~ *not complete yet, is a redirect*.

I prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my text editor when given an option (you can find a list of my most-used extensions [here](vscode-extensions)) - but for short edits will usually open [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is my photo editor, and since my PC can't really video edit very well, I'm still using the Microsoft Photos editor built into Windows 10.

Someday maybe this should be its own page? Lol
